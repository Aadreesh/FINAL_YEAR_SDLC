# Introduction

The basic problem statement of the project is inefficient traffic congestion. Due to asynchronous traffic mobility channel contension is higher which leads to reduced traffic efficiency in roads along with much higher time and fuel consumption.

# Dynamic Vehicle Platoon Formation

The platooning concept can be defined as a collection of vehicles
that travel together, actively coordinated in formation.
