# Introduction

The basic problem statement of the project is inefficient traffic congestion. Due to asynchronous traffic mobility channel contension is higher which leads to reduced traffic efficiency in roads along with much higher time and fuel consumption.

# Dynamic Vehicle Platoon Formation

The platooning concept can be defined as a collection of vehicles
that travel together, actively coordinated in formation.

# Advantages

* Increase of road capacity
* Reduction of environmental impacts
* Improved safety
* Improved driver comfort

# Defining the System

The lead vehicles always interacts with other vehicles to 
* Either include an extra vehicle into platoon or exclude existing vehicle from platoon
* To provide and fetch infromation about environment with RSU (Road Side Unit).
